## Relay a Track

By relaying media data from a source track to one or more destination tracks by servers, contents are delivered to a wider audience or users.
To forward media data, a server subscribes to a source track as a subscriber to upstream and handles one or more downstream subscriptions as a publisher.

```go
    var src *moqt.TrackReader
    var dests []*moqt.TrackWriter

    for {
        gr, err := src.Read()
        if err != nil {
            break
        }

        go func(gr *moqt.GroupReader) {
            defer gr.Close()
            seq := gr.GroupSequence()

            writers := make([]*moqt.GroupWriter, 0, len(dests))
            for _, dest := range dests {
                gw, err := dest.OpenGroup(seq)
                if err != nil {
                    break
                }

                writers = append(writers, gw)
            }

            for {

> [!TIP] Tip: The First Subscription
> Making the first subscription before downstream clients have subscribed can reduce latency, but may increase resource usage. This trade-off should be considered when designing your relay logic.
> When the track is a high-frequency track (e.g., video), it is recommended to make the first subscription after downstream clients subscribe to avoid unnecessary resource consumption.

## Relay Broadcasts

`TrackMux` acts as a hub for relaying broadcasts.

> [!NOTE] Note: Relay Implementation
> `gomoqt` does not provide built-in implementation for relaying broadcasts and tracks because there are many scenarios on relaying and many different implementations. The relay implementation is left to the user.

## Caching

To enhance UX, consider implementing caching strategies for frequently accessed data or long-lived objects. This can help reduce latency and improve overall performance. Some common caching techniques include:

1. **In-Memory Caching**: Store frequently accessed data in memory (RAM) for quick retrieval.
2. **Distributed Caching**: Use a distributed cache system to share cached data across multiple instances.
3. **Cache Invalidation**: Implement strategies to invalidate stale cache entries to ensure data consistency.

By leveraging caching, you can significantly improve the responsiveness of your application and provide a smoother user experience.
